## Movie Recommender System

> We are going to write a movie recommender system using k-nearest neighbors method based on similarity (or distance) of features of movies.
> <br/>We use TMDB dataset from [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata).
>
> K-nearest neighbor method from scratch is completely explained [here](https://github.com/salidotir/Neural-Network-Projects/blob/master/Movie%20Recommender%20KNearestNeighbors/KNearestNeighbor.ipynb).
